# Data-Modeling-with-Postgres
In this project, we’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. We’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL we will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new tables.
